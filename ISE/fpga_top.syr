INFO:Xst:2117 - HDL ADVISOR - Mux Selector <CurrentState> of Case statement line 339 was re-encoded using one-hot encoding. The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:
